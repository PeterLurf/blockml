# Pan and Zoom Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Panning Not Working**
**Problem**: Mouse events were only triggering when mouse was over the canvas element
**Solution**: 
- Moved mouse event handlers to global document listeners
- Fixed event coordination between canvas and global handlers
- Proper event prevention to avoid conflicts

### 2. **Zoom Not Working**
**Problem**: Multiple issues with zoom functionality
**Solutions**:
- Fixed duplicate zoom buttons (removed one)
- Added Ctrl+scroll wheel zoom functionality
- Improved zoom center calculation to zoom towards mouse position
- Enhanced zoom limits (0.1x to 5x)

### 3. **User Experience Improvements**
- Added visual cursor feedback (grab/grabbing)
- Added zoom indicator showing current zoom percentage
- Added helpful instructions for pan and zoom controls
- Improved button styling and organization

## Technical Changes Made

### Graph Editor (`components/graph-editor.tsx`)

#### 1. Enhanced Global Mouse Handlers
```typescript
// Combined mouse move handler for both panning and dragging
const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
  // Handle canvas panning
  if (isDragging && !draggedNode && !connecting) {
    setPan({
      x: e.clientX - dragStart.x,
      y: e.clientY - dragStart.y,
    })
  }
  // Handle node dragging and mouse position tracking
}
```

#### 2. Added Wheel Zoom
```typescript
const handleWheel = useCallback(
  (e: React.WheelEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault() // No Ctrl key required
    // Zoom towards mouse position with proper calculations
  },
  [zoom, pan],
)
```

#### 3. Middle Mouse Button Panning
```typescript
const handleCanvasMouseDown = useCallback(
  (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
    // Only pan with middle mouse button (button 1)
    if (e.button === 1 && ...) {
      setIsDragging(true)
      // Start panning
    }
    // Left click for selection without panning
    else if (e.button === 0 && ...) {
      setSelectedNode(null)
    }
  },
  [pan, connecting],
)
```

#### 3. Improved Canvas Event Handling
- Added proper event prevention
- Enhanced cursor states
- Better coordination between different interaction modes

#### 4. UI Enhancements
- Fixed duplicate zoom button
- Added zoom indicator in top-left
- Added pan/zoom instructions in bottom-right
- Better visual feedback throughout

## Controls Reference

### Panning
- **Middle Mouse Button**: Click and drag with middle mouse button to pan
- **Visual Feedback**: Cursor changes to move cursor during drag
- **Left Click**: Select/deselect nodes without panning

### Zooming
- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll up/down to zoom in/out towards mouse position
- **Zoom In Button**: Click + button in toolbar
- **Zoom Out Button**: Click - button in toolbar
- **Reset View**: Click maximize button to reset zoom and pan
- **Zoom Range**: 10% to 500% (0.1x to 5x)

### Visual Indicators
- **Zoom Level**: Displayed in top-left corner
- **Instructions**: Shown in bottom-right corner
- **Cursor States**: Default cursor for selection, move cursor for panning

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Panning**:
   - Middle-click and drag on empty canvas areas
   - Canvas should move smoothly
   - Left-click should not cause panning

2. **Test Zoom**:
   - Scroll mouse wheel up/down
   - Should zoom towards mouse position
   - Zoom indicator should update in real-time

3. **Test Zoom Buttons**:
   - Click + and - buttons in toolbar
   - Should zoom in/out from center
   - Reset button should return to 100% zoom and center position

4. **Test Combined Operations**:
   - Try panning after zooming
   - Ensure nodes stay properly positioned
   - Verify connections render correctly at all zoom levels

## Key Improvements

### Performance
- Optimized event handling to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Smooth animations with proper transition timing
- Efficient coordinate calculations

### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- Intuitive controls that match standard desktop app conventions
- Helpful on-screen instructions and indicators

### Reliability
- Proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Robust error handling for edge cases
- Consistent behavior across different interaction modes

The pan and zoom functionality now works seamlessly and provides a professional desktop application experience!
