# App Icon Generation Script

# Since we can't generate PNG directly, use this SVG file with an online converter:
# 1. Go to https://convertio.co/svg-png/ or https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
# 2. Upload the app-icon.svg file
# 3. Set output size to 512x512 pixels
# 4. Download as icon.png and place in this directory

# For electron app, you'll also need:
# - icon.ico (Windows) - convert PNG to ICO
# - icon.icns (macOS) - convert PNG to ICNS using https://iconverticons.com/online/

# The current app-icon.svg shows a modern neural network visualization
# with gradient background and clean node connections.
